# Porsche_Hackathon
Runner up project of the 2019 Porsche Hackathon in Atlanta. Organized by Atalytics. Total 35 teams participated in this contest with members consisting of leading Data scientist from various major corporations across Atlanta. 

There were 3 questions and we took a novel approach for answering each questing using Data-driven methodologies. 

This can be a good case study for aspiring Data scientist. 

# Where to build which charging stations and why?

# What customers are likely to buy which EV's, which ones aren't?

# Who should we market to, what kind of cars and where?


Project methadology is explained in the Video presentation and resources for each questions are there in the respective individual folder.
